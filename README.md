# Wordpress plugin
# Displaying current BEST courses and list of lbgs on wordpress site

Plugin is in development as part of project for IT students.

In this stage we don't provide any documentation.

Plugin usage:
-
Create a Post or (preferably) Page with the following shortcode tag as its text content:

`[best_events]` - Displays a table with current BEST Courses.

`[best_lbgs]` - Displays Local Best Groups.

`[best_lbgs_map]` - Displays Local Best Groups as a Map.

There are also relevant buttons for adding them in the default TinyMCE editor.
